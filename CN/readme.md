## LIST OF EXPERIMENTS

1. Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine. 

2. Write a HTTP web client program to download a web page using TCP sockets
          
3. Applications using TCP sockets like:
     - Echo client and echo server
     - Chat
     - File Transfer
     
4. Simulation of DNS using UDP sockets.
